AI-powered YouTube content creation using prompt engineering

 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how prompt engineering can be used to automate the complete YouTube content creation workflow. Using a structured prompt chain, AI was used to generate video titles, a full YouTube script, and a thumbnail concept, simulating a real-world creator and digital marketing process.

 Project Deliverables
One prompt chain document
One YouTube script (800–1500 words)
One YouTube-ready video
One thumbnail concept (AI-generated)
